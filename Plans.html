<p>When I graduate, I want to work in a position that enables me to support my family.</P>
<p>I've always wished to lessen the stress on our home and a few of the difficulties my family has encountered. 
I am aware of think working will help me feel more dependence and responsibility.</p>
<p>My main goal is to respect my parents by helping them in every manner I can. 
I also want to become useful knowledge and abilities that will enable me to develop both on a personal and professional level.  Getting a job will not only enable me to provide cash assistance, but it will show me the value of patience and loyalty.  I'm determined to put in a lot of effort at work and taking advantage of every chance.</P>
